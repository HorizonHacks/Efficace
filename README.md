**IMPORTANT:** How to Make with _xampp_
1. Install and open xampp control panel.
2. Activate Apache and MySQL
3. Type "http://localhost/phpmyadmin" into browser.
4. Create a new database, name it whatever.
5. Go to xammp -> htdocs, make a new folder (this is where all your php & html-related pages will go).
6. Open the files in this repo with a text editor. I used sublime text, but there are many other options.
7. To run, use "localhost/(your folder name)/(whatever page)"
